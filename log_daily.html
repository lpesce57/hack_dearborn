    What is a goal you have retained from childhood? How have you continued to work towards it?

    As a kid, I always wanted to be an author. I loved to read and I loved to write. I used to make up short stories in my head and I daydreamed about different ideas constantly. Now that I'm older, publishing a book seems as if it would pose much more of a challenge. However, I want it to happen. I have decided to minor in English and I hope that is helpful in my journey. Now that I think about it though, I haven't been working towards this dream as much. I keep putting it off because I have pressing deadlines and this can wait but I want to start making more of an active effort. I think I am going to start writing a little bit before bed each night. It won't be quick, but at least I will know I am making progress.
