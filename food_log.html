<p>Eating should be both enjoyable and sustainable for your body. However, eating healthy does not neccesarily mean eating less or cutting back on your favorite foods.
    You can eat healthy and still induldge on a sweet treat. Additionally, it is more important to eat a variety of foods to assure you getting enough
    nutrients as opposed to counting calories. We hope to help make tracking your food about how you feel after eating each food and making sure 
    you are getting all of the food groups you need to be healthy!
