    <p> Having good mental health is equally as important as having good physical health. However,
        people often do not prioritize their mental health as much. If you are able to set aside as little
        as 5 minutes a day, you will feel immense improvements! What better way to track your journey than
        with your very own digital diary. With MyDiary, you are able to look back at past entries or just go directly to today.
        You can keep track of your mood, write about your day, track your daily accomplishments and take a minute to breathe.
        Additionally, you can check out our food log! As opposed to regular dieting and calorie-counting apps,
        we promote healthy eating without hyperfixating on tracking your food to an exact science. We have categories to place your foods in based
        on what food group it is a part of, what time you ate it, a rating of your enjoyment and you can even upload photos of your food to remember 
        that savory meal. Don't stress over how many awesome features there are, you can pick and choose what you want to use. You can put as much or as little time
        and effort as you want. Remember: this is YOUR experience, do it your way!
